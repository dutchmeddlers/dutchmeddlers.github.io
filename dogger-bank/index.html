 <h2> Battle of Dogger Bank </h2>
        <p> The British, although stretched thin, dealing with campaigns in the Americas, had to divert some of their navy to blockade the Dutch ports following shortly after their entry to the war. The Dutch merchants camplained that they would loose their business, so the Dutch took action, beginning to escort convoys. The British however, were not keen on letting the Dutch export and import materials, so the British, under admiral Sir Hyde Parker, engaged the force. The Dutch were outgunned, however the British were running low on supplies. After the battle both sides claimed victory, although regardless it was another blow that the British would have to repair, and in addition to being struck by the French, Spaniards, and Americans it became too much, helping the American collonies gain independence.  </p>
