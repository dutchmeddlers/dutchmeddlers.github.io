    <h2> Prewar </h2>
    <p> Before the American Revolutionary war, the Dutch had been allies with the British. It had been a long time since the last war between the countries. However, the Stadholder of the Netherlands, William, attempted to support the British, became very disliked by the Dutch people. This would eventually lead to the Dutch entry into the war against the British. </p>
