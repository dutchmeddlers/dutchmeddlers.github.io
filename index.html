    <h2> Main course of the war </h2>
    <p>   In the American Revolutionary War the Dutch Republic was one of the nations aiding the felgling American 13 colonies to victory. Without European assistance it would have been impossible for the American colonies to win the war. The Dutch were instrumental in this, providing support to the American colonies and in 1781, starting their own war against the British. Without the Dutch aid in this endeavour, the Americans would have lost the support of the first country to recognize them as an independent country, and an instrumental force in locking down the British fleet in Europe, paying for their attempt to help the American with their own lives.</p>
    <h2> Battle of Dogger Bank </h2>
        <p> The British, although stretched thin, dealing with campaigns in the Americas, had to divert some of their navy to blockade the Dutch ports following shortly after their entry to the war. The Dutch merchants camplained that they would loose their business, so the Dutch took action, beginning to escort convoys. The British however, were not keen on letting the Dutch export and import materials, so the British, under admiral Sir Hyde Parker, engaged the force. The Dutch were outgunned, however the British were running low on supplies. After the battle both sides claimed victory, although regardless it was another blow that the British would have to repair, and in addition to being struck by the French, Spaniards, and Americans it became too much, helping the American collonies gain independence.  </p>
    <h2> Influences of the Dutch Government </h2>
    <p>  The Dutch Government, although a republic, was a warning to the American Colonists on what to avoid. George Washington himself said the idea of political parties was a terrible idea and would eventually lead to the desmise of the American political system. This was in their view in seeing the Dutch political system. Warring parties unable to find middle ground and to bridge divides.</p>
